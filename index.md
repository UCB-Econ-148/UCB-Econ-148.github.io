Overview
----
This course will give the undergraduate student the basic computational building blocks needed to be a good consumer and producer of applied economics work. Students will work to acquire data through APIs, access census data, or download from replication repositories. The course will cover wrangling data, working with incomplete or unstructured data, joining and merging data, exploratory data analysis and data visualization. The course will cover many aspects of preparing data for econometric analysis. Practices around literate code, open science tools, reproducibility, and data management will also be covered.

This course is intented for upper-division students and as of 2024 is offered in the Spring. The pre-requisite for the class is Data 8, and the course is not recommended for students who have already taken Data 100.  If you are interested in our lower division course where is all started with Data Science Undergraduate Studies, please check out [Data 88e](https://data88e.org), which is currently offered in Fall Semester.
